    <p>Lewiston is the second-largest city in the state of Maine, after Portland. With its neighboring city of Auburn, it makes up the Lewiston-Auburn Metro Area. It's known for its hospitals and schools, and its culture is heavily influenced by its Somali and French-Canadian populations. The Androscoggin River flows through Lewiston, and the city's economy has always depended on drawing power from the river.</p>
